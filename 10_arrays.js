//ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ Difference between slice and splice
/*
1. The first difference is that in SLICE the 2nd value (index no.) is not included but in case of SPLICE its just the opposite 
2. The second difference is that in SLICE the original array is not changed but in case of SPLICE the original array is changed.
3. In case of splice only the removed element is printed as  an output means the return value but to see the change in the original array you have to console.log again.
