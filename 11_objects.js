//singleton - 
//When we craete object literals they don't form singleton
//when we craete object as a constructor then they form singleton

//2 types --- literals, constructor

//ðŸŸ¡Object Literals
//Object.create --- this is how a constructor is created

const obj1 = {};


//accessing an objects value - types

const obj2 = {

        city: "Silchar",
        state: "Assam"
    }
}

console.log(obj2.name);

console.log(obj2["name"]); //behind the scene this name (all the keys of objects are treated as a string) is treated as a string that is why we have to put the key inside ""
//the second type for accessing an object is useful when you have this type of key inside your object
const obj3 = {
    name: "Kunal",
    "currently studying" : "BTech"
}
//console.log(obj3."currently studying");
console.log(obj3["studying"]);






//ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”´ Important facts about SYMBOLS in objects
//Q. Create a symbol and add the symbol as a key to the object
const sym = Symbol("symbolKey"); //the type is symbol here

const obj4 = {
    name: "new",
    [sym]: "anyValue" //but if we check the type of obj.sym it will be string because it is detecting only the values type here but we want to make the whole as a symbol to do so we have to wrap the key inside []
} 
console.log(obj4.sym);
console.log(typeof sym);
console.log(obj4[sym]);






//ðŸ”´ðŸ”´To freez an object

}

Object.freeze(obj5); //always remember to unfreez the object if you are further using that object in any other segmnet of code. Otherwise the output will show undefined.
obj5.name = "Sneha"

//ðŸ”´ðŸ”´Functions in an object

const obj6 = {

//ðŸŸ¡using constructor
//in object literals we create an empty object as (const empObj = {}) -------- just the difference is object literals are singleton objects and objects with constructors are non-singleton objects
//here
const tinderUser = new Object();   //with the new keyword
