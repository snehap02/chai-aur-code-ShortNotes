//singleton - 
//When we craete object literals they don't form singleton
//when we craete object as a constructor then they form singleton

//2 types --- literals, constructor

//ðŸŸ¡Object Literals
//Object.create --- this is how a constructor is created

//accessing an objects value - types

}

console.log(obj2.name);

console.log(obj2["name"]); //behind the scene this name (all the keys of objects are treated as a string) is treated as a string that is why we have to put the key inside ""
//the second type for accessing an object is useful when you have this type of key inside your object

//ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”´ Important facts about SYMBOLS in objects
//Q. Create a symbol and add the symbol as a key to the object
const sym = Symbol(); //the type is symbol here

const obj4 = {
    name: "new",
    [sym]: "anyValue" //but if we check the type of obj.sym it will be string because itis detecting only the values type here but we want to make the whole as a symbol to do so we have to wrap the key inside []
